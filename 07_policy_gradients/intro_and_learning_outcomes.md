## INTRODUCTION TO THE MODULE

Q-Learning took an indirect approach to improving policies: it used value functions as intermediate quantities. In this module, we take a direct approach by parametrizing the policy directly. We will study different algorithms and approaches for improving efficiency. We will also study the benefits of the approach. In the lab, we will revisit the Cart Pole environment and show that policy gradient offers an improved technique.


## LEARNING OUTCOMES

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain the policy gradient approach
- Explain and implement the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm
- Explain the limitation of REINFORCE as a practical method
- Explain the benefit of using cost-to-go
- Understand extensions of REINFORCE: why is a baseline useful
- Understand why a critic is useful
