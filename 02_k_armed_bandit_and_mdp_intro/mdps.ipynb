    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, time-varying state spaces are often modeled with Markov Decision Processes (MDP).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each time step *t*, an agent observes the current state of the environment $s_t$,  \n",
    "takes action $a_t$, receives reward $r_t$, and transitions to new state $s_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "MDPs originate from field of *optimal control*\n",

    "Very useful and applicable framework to decision-learning problems based on three signals:\n",

    "- the basis on which choices are made (states)\n",
    "- signal to define agent's goal (rewards)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- they can model sequential decision-making\n",
    "- the agent can be in a set of different states (finite or continuous)\n",
    "- actions can be discrete or continuous\n",
    "- the rewards are short-term, but collectively result in long-term value\n",
    "\n",
    "A word about the **Markov** property:\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the future state will depend only on the current state. These sorts of processes are much easier to model.  \n",

    "A Markov decision process is a 4-tuple $(S,A,P,R)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ is the state space  \n",

    "$P$ is the probability transition matrix  \n",
